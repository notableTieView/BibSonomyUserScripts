# BibSonomyUserScripts
UserScripts (Greasemonkey, Tampermonkey, ...) to tweak the user interface of BibSonomy

These scripts can be downloaded and installed from [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en/users/19427-notabletieview/ "user account of notableTieView at Greasy Fork")

## BibSonomy_BibTeX_Link
Insert a Link to the BibTeX of the publications shown in a publication list into the main menu. When a BibSonomy page contains a list of publications, a link is appended to the main menu. The link's target is the BibTeX mass export of all publications in the list. [[Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/13569-bibsonomy-bibtex-link "This user script at Greasy Fork")]

## BibSonomy_Search_Switcher
Switch the search from the (page dependent) search type to fulltext search. When a user is logged in, the search type is set to the user search ("search:<Username>"), otherwise to the overall fulltext search ("search:all").
