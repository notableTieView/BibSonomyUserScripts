# BibSonomyUserScripts
UserScripts (Greasemonkey, Tampermonkey, ...) to tweak the user interface of BibSonomy

* BibSonomy_BibTeX_Link: Insert a Link to the BibTeX of the publications shown in a publication list into the main menu. When a BibSonomy page contains a list of publications, a link is appended to the main menu. The link's target is the BibTeX mass export of all publications in the list.
* BibSonomy_Search_Switcher: Switch the search from the (page dependent) search type to fulltext search. When a user is logged in, the search type is set to the user search ("search:<Username>"), otherwise to the overall fulltext search ("search:all")
